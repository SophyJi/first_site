            <p>Nanjing is a popular city full of Chinese history and old traditional southern kinds of agriculture. As a northern people from China, Nanjing was the first city that I traveled to the region south of the Yangtze River. Confucius Temple - Qinhuai River is the most famous place to show the beauty of Nanjing.</p>
            
            <p>Confucius temple has many traditional temple agricultures inside and many small shops about traditional Nanjing specialties and popular restaurants. There are also many colorful traditional lanterns which made the night of qinhuai more gorgeous. People can also take the “Hua Fang” ( a special kind of ship) to travel around the river and the whole scenery.  </p>
